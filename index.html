      <h2>Have You Tried Turning It On and Off Again?</h2>
      <h5>By Maurice Moss</h5>

        It's the statement made famous by the Channel 4 show 'The IT Crowd' and repeated every time you say that you work for an IT Support company! We may say it in many different ways "can you reboot?," "could you power down the machine?" or "have you tried re-configuring the primary power coupling." They all mean the same thing! The thing is it actually works quite a lot of the time, which is why "have you tried turning it off and on again" may well be what an IT Support engineer asks you to do. <strong>-https://www.your-itdepartment.co.uk</strong>

        <h4>Tabs vs. Spaces</h4>
        <img src="assets/article-one.png" alt="picture of code on a monitor">
        <p>At the end of the day, tabs versus spaces is truly a matter of preference, however the tab is still the character specifically designed for indentation, and using one tab character per indentation level instead of 2 or 4 spaces will use less disk space / memory / compiler resources and the like. tâ€™s also arguable that full tab indentation produces more readable code <strong>-https://kennethreilly.medium.com/</strong></p>

        <h4>How Much Caffeine Is Too Much?</h4>
        <img src="assets/article-two.png" alt="black and white cup of coffee">
        <p>Healthy adults shouldn't consume more than 400 milligrams (mg) of caffeine per day. That's equal to about four 8-ounce cups of brewed coffee or 10 cans of cola. Teens should limit their caffeine intake to less than 100 mg per day (one 8-ounce cup of coffee or about two cans of cola). <strong>https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much</strong></p>
